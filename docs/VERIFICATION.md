# Verification record

Implementation date: September 10, 2026. Native target: Apple Silicon macOS (`aarch64-apple-darwin`), built with Rust 1.94.1.

Final result: **16 Rust tests and 24 extension tests passed**. Clippy, Rust formatting, TypeScript checking, release build and extension bundling passed. Both ZIP archives passed integrity checks.

## Automated checks

- Rust unit and integration tests cover strict policy/unknown handling, terminal sanitization, keep-list persistence, account isolation, duplicate dispatch rejection, restart recovery, actual loopback WebSocket pairing and origin/session rejection, default-cancel confirmation, reconnect invalidation, modal stop controls, completed-action checkpoint recovery, shared Rust/TypeScript policy fixtures, and empty/narrow terminal rendering.
- Extension tests cover response parsing, verification flags, exact ID strings, pagination, relationship absence, empty/tombstoned activity, pinned posts, repost timestamps, operation discovery, allowlisted commands, duplicate work, uncertain journaling, acknowledgement/reconciliation, asynchronous mutual exclusion, disconnect/pause generation invalidation, and preflight versus post-dispatch errors.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, Rust formatting, TypeScript checking and production bundling are part of the release checks.

The test inputs are synthetic fixtures. They do not certify undocumented X response shapes or endpoint availability.

## Manual checks

The native release binary is exercised in a real terminal with `--demo`, using six fictional accounts. The workflow includes selection, cancellation, approval, fake removal and clean exit. The Chrome options page is visually inspected as a local file in an isolated browser, without using a signed-in X profile. Its extension-only Chrome APIs are not available in that local-file preview; this was a layout check, not an installed-extension integration test.

## Remaining live qualification

No real account was scanned or modified during development. Live compatibility remains unverified for session-based follower pagination, relationship lookup, replies/reposts coverage, `RemoveFollower`, and post-removal verification. Discovered operation IDs are capability candidates, not successful endpoint probes.

Before a real cleanup, verify the owner, collect a small inventory and inspect its evidence. A separately reviewed small removal trial must establish that native removal works and independently confirm the incoming relationship disappears. Private API failures and X restrictions may require changes in `extension/src/x-client.ts` or `parsers.ts`. The application deliberately stops or retains unknown evidence when it cannot establish these facts.

## Review changes

A focused reuse/quality/efficiency review removed duplicate action identity inputs/matches, avoided idle redraws and off-screen row allocation, corrected focus after filtering, avoided repeated credential storage, and allowed forced operation refresh. It also identified and fixed pause queue races, stale owner confirmations, account changes during verification, and incomplete activity evidence.
